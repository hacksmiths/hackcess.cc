  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  <h2>Should I come to this hackathon?</h2>
  <p>Yes*. Next question!</p>
  <h2>But<h2>
  <p>No buts! Come to the hackathon!</p>
  <h2>I've never been to a hackathon before!</h2>
  <p>Well, here's where you start</p>
  <h2>Do you own my hack?</h2>
  <p>What? No, of course not, we're not parasitic lawyers. We don't even have lawyers!</p>
  <h2>How much?</h2>
  <p>How much? No. It's not. No much. How more not much could it get? None more no much. (for clarity over comedy here, it's free. no excuse not to come)</p>
  <h2>Can I work on projects I start before the hack/coursework/working for the man/working for a living?</h2>
  <p>Dolly Parton, you're welcome. No prize eligibility though, in the interest of fairness</p>
  <h2>Can I turn up and be an asshole?</h2>
  <p>WHO EVEN ASKS THAT! NO! OF COURSE NOT! We adhere to the MLH code of conduct, and we have big angry men to throw you out if you do something awful.</p>
  <h2>How big should teams be?</h2>
  <p>Four. No more, no less. Or less, if you want. No more though, that'd open the door to all kinds of crazy hacking of the hacking system</p>
  <p>Please note that due to legal constraints, we're not able to organise for under 18s to attend. We're sorry! Write to your MP.</p>
